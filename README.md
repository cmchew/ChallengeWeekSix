# ChallengeWeekSix
Your application must include the following:
A table for employees
Each employee should have a name, job title, and the name of the department they work under (you can add more info)
A table for departments
A homepage for the company where anyone can view (with url = "localhost:8080/")
A page listing of all departments where anyone can view
A page listing of employees for each department where only logged in users can view
Only logged in users can view detail employee information 
Only admin can add or update department
Only admin can add or update employee
Only admin can deactivate employees to marked as "no longer employed" - deletion is not allowed
Create a user with id = "admin" and password = "admin" with ADMIN role
Create a user with id = "mc" and password = "mc" with USER role
Functionality is most important but include some bootstrap to make the pages look NICE!
 

Done already?

Add Search functionality to search an employee or "no longer employed" employees
Add Department Managers (with MANAGER role)
Use many bootstrap's functionalities as possible
